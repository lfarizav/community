# Organization of work in Magma development

## Roles

### Contributors

Anyone can become a Contributor by submitting a pull request to the project
and having that change accepted through the projectâ€™s review process. A
Contributor is someone who has had code merged within the last 12 months.
Contributors are eligible to vote in governance elections. Contributors have
access to propose and review code but not merge the code into repos of the
project.

### Maintainers

A Maintainer has the ability to merge code into the project. Maintainers are
active Contributors and participants in the project. In order to become a
Maintainer, you must be nominated and approved by the established Maintainers,
through a simple majority vote with no existing maintainer objecting.
Within the project, sub-components may decide to have additional requirements
for the review of code in their repos.
