## Technical Committee

The Technical Committee (TC) is comprised of 5 members who are responsible for architectural decisions and making final decisions if Maintainers cannot come to an agreement. The initial members will be appointed to 12 month terms with a goal of moving to an elected TC membership within 24 months. Once elections begin, the elections will be staggered so that only a portion of the TC seats is up for election in each cycle. 

There are no term limits, but in order to encourage diversity, no more than 2 of the 5 seats can be filled by any one organization. The TC will meet regularly in an open forum with times and locations published in community channels.

The exact size and model for the TC may evolve over time based on the needs and growth of the project, but the governing body will always be committed to openness, diversity and the principle that technical decisions are made by technical contributors.

**Any individual may hold multiple roles simultaneously such as being a Maintainer and a member of the TC.**
