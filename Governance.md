# Magma governance

Magma is committed to implementing the
[Four Opens](https://www.openstack.org/four-opens/): Open source, Open
development, Open design and Open community. An open governance model, where
technical decisions are made by technical contributors and a representative
body accessible to every contributor, is a critical part in establishing a
truly open community.

Magma's project open governance model will be put in place in several steps,
in order to give time for the common team to form from various corporate
workgroups, and to allow natural leaders to emerge.

## Step 1 (current): Interim governance

At this early stage in the formation of the project, Magma is currently
operating with minimal viable governance. Early critical project decisions
are generally made in two areas: approving code changes for inclusion into
Magma, and early release and roadmap decisions.

For the first area, Magma uses GitHub maintainers groups. New maintainers
must be nominated and approved by established maintainers through a simple
majority with no existing maintainer objecting.

For the second area, Magma uses a Release Management team, with the following
individuals:

- Michael Callahan
- Jacky Tian (@xjtian)
- Sanaz Bazargan

Addition of new members requires approval of all current release management
team members.

## Step 2: Initial governance

Magma will initially be governed by a Technical Committee with members
appointed by Magmaâ€™s 3 sponsoring organizations, OIA, TIP and OIF. At that
point, the TC will be responsible for further updates to Governance documents.

This initial TC will be tasked with:

- appointing additional TC members as natural leaders emerge
- establishing initial operating procedures and governance for the project
- handling the transition to a fully-elected representation in the future
